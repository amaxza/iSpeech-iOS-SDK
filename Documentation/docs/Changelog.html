<li>Decreased CPU usage.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0b5 - July 9th, 2012</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed issues where errors were sometimes incorrectly returned to the SDK from the server.</li>
<li>Fixed several memory leaks.</li>
<li>Fixed UI issues.</li>
<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: CFNetwork.framework has been added to the SDK and now must be linked against.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0b4 - June 4th, 2012</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed instances where started speaking and finished speaking synthesis delegate calls were happening at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed speech recognition not timing out properly when called with <code>-[ISSpeechRecognition listenAndRecognizeWithTimeout:error:]</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed speech synthesis where, in rare cases, towards the end of audio, tapping &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t always stop audio.</li>
<li>Fixed speed not being set properly for speech synthesis.</li>
<li>Fixed speech synthesis always returning that the user cancelled synthesis, even if they didn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with two popups being displayed.</li>
<li>Added check to make sure we have valid text before performing synthesis.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>busy</code> on <code>iSpeechSDK</code> to <code>isBusy</code>. Your code for calling it shouldn&rsquo;t change.</li>
<li>Updated Compatibility class for better ARC detection.</li>
<li>Updated Compatibility class to properly transform <code>ISpeechErrorDomain</code> into <code>iSpeechErrorDomain</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0b3 - May 18th, 2012</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the SDK not seeing &ldquo;startRecord.wav&rdquo; and throwing an exception.</li>
<li>Fixed the sample app not working on pre-iOS 5.0.</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed SDK not vibrating when vibrations are turned on.</li>
<li>Fixed Compatibility Class not setting ISSpeechRecognition delegate.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with speech recognition dialog popping up and then disappearing.</li>
<li>Fixed leaks without an autorelease pool.</li>
<li>Added option to set bit rate of synthesis.</li>
<li>Added adaptive bit rate, to automatically adjust depending on network connection.</li>
<li>Updated bundle with optimized images.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 1.0b1 - May 1st, 2012</h2>

<h4>iSpeech SDK: The Sequel</h4>

<p>Good news, everyone! The iSpeech SDK for iOS has been rewritten from scratch to improve a number of things.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum OS Requirement</strong>: Due to the SDK using several newer technologies to implement certain features, it now requires iOS 4.0 or higher.</li>
<li><strong>Segmentation</strong>: The SDK has now been split up into multiple classes to make it easier to work with.</li>
<li><strong>Better Audio Session Management</strong>: In old versions of the SDK, the AudioSession would get activated right when you initialized the SDK, shutting down any other audio. Now, the audio session is only activated when it&rsquo;s needed, and then shut down when it&rsquo;s not, which results in a better experience for the user.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Configuration</strong>: It&rsquo;s now easier to configure the SDK, and setup a specific synthesis instance with certain properties.</li>
<li><strong>Fewer Dependencies</strong>: We&rsquo;ve dramatically reduced the number of frameworks you need to link against to three: <code>AudioToolbox.framework</code>, <code>SystemConfiguration.framework</code>, and <code>Security.framework</code>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 0.9.2 - Jan. 19, 2012</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed recognition lists so that they actually work.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with speech synthesis on Verizon 3G.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 0.9.1 - Nov. 2, 2011</h2>

<ul>
<li>The SDK is now provided as a universal binary, which means with one file, you can compile for both the Simulator and for Device. Xcode will strip out anything it doesn&rsquo;t need when building for Release.</li>
<li>Added iOS 3 support to the SDK for those that require it.</li>
<li>Added error codes. Now every error code has a enum value for easier code reading of error status codes.</li>
<li>Added error parameter to several methods. Now, if something goes wrong, and a method returns <code>NO</code>, if you pass in a pointer to an error object, you&rsquo;ll get error details back out of the method.</li>
<li>Added network checking. The SDK will now check to see if it can connect to the Internet. If it can&rsquo;t, whichever method you call will return <code>NO</code>, and you&rsquo;ll get the <code>kISpeechErrorCodeNoInternetConnection</code> error code from the <code>NSError</code> reference you pass in. As a result, you&rsquo;ll need to now link against SystemConfiguration.framework.</li>
<li>Added input checking. If no mic is available (such as on a 2nd gen. iPod touch, any methods that start speech recognition will return <code>NO</code>, and you&rsquo;ll get the <code>kISpeechErrorCodeNoInputAvailable</code> error code from the <code>NSError</code> reference you pass in.</li>
<li>Added speed. Now you can set the speed of speech synthesis.</li>
<li>Added locale. Now you can set the locale for speech recognition, allowing you to recognition different languages.</li>
<li>Added model. Now you can specify a model for the SDK, if your API Key supports that.</li>
<li><code>ISpeechStopListenStartRecognize</code> will now not return <code>NO</code> if you&rsquo;re doing a timed listen, and will in fact stop listening and start recognizing.</li>
<li>Added extra params. Now, if needed, you can send extra parameters to the server. <strong>Use only if directed.</strong></li>
<li>Delegates will now be notified if the user presses &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; on any of the dialogs. They will get an error whose code is <code>kISpeechErrorCodeUserCancelled</code>.</li>
</ul>
